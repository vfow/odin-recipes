                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> 2 large eggs </li>
                    <li>  ½ cup milk </li>
                    <li>  ½ cup water </li>
                    <li>  ¼ teaspoon salt </li>
                    <li>  1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
                    <li>  2 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; 
                        add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth.
                     </li>
                    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe.
                         Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                        Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other 
                        side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
